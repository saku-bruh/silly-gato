# 🚗 thiscatdoesnotexist

An absurd (and maybe far-too-high-effort) parody of [thispersondoesnotexist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com) — re-imagined with a rather… fluffy twist.

---

## ✨ what is this?

**thiscatdoesnotexist** pulls random cat photos (and GIFs!) from the web — so your own kitty might pop up here one day. Whether you’re after the parody angle or just want to lose yourself in silly-faced felines, you’ve definitely come to the right place.

## 😺 why?

Because the internet doesn’t show me *enough* cats daily.  
And because I could, therefore… I did.

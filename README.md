ðŸš— thiscatdoesnotexist

a absurd and maybe too high of an effort parody of [thispersondoesnotexist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com), reimagined with a rather... fluffy twist?

âœ¨ what is this?

thiscatdoesnotexist pulls images of cats from the web (which luckily exist so you might find one out there or heck maybe even one of your cats is on there)

whether you're here for the parody, or just to lose yourself in the eyes of silly animals, you've come to the right place.

ðŸ˜º why?

because the internet doesnâ€™t show me enough cats daily.
and of course because I could, and therefore... I did.
